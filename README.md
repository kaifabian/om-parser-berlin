om-parser-berlin
================

OpenMensa: Provides a feed parser for the canteens in Berlin (Studentenwerk Berlin).

I know, the code is messy and pretty fucked up. But it is working. So feel free to write one yourself or clean up the code, if you like. ;)

The current parser requires the following python packages:
- lxml >= 3.0.0
- beautifulsoup >= 3.0.0
(also: see requirements.txt)
