om-parser-berlin
================

OpenMensa: Provides a feed parser for the canteens in Berlin (Studentenwerk Berlin).

I know, the code is messy and pretty fucked up. For example the compFormat() function in mensa.py that provides compatibility between Python 2.5 and Python 2.7. But it is working. ;)

Feel free to write one yourself or clean up the code. :)
